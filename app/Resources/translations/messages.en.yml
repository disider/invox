      Other than a tool, <strong>Invox</strong> is a <em>skilled accountant</em> that helps you for the administration. You can create a client and supplier list, linking each profile with the invoice data. You can generate orders and quotes for the clients that ask you for a work.
      When the quote is accepted by your client, the order and the corresponding invoice in PDF format are automatically generated.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the âfirst noteâ section the payments done or received are linked to their respective invoices. Thanks to this operation your bank accounts are updated automatically. You can add one or more bank accounts or credit/debt cards depending on your needs, managing them separately. With Invox you have a tool at your service for the economic-financial management.
